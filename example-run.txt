Should teachers be fired for being gay?

Title:  Should teachers be fired for being gay?

Thesis:  When asked should teachers be fired for being gay, the short answer is no, a teacher should not be fired for being gay. That is pure discrimination. The sexual orientation of a person has nothing to do with their ability to teach. A teacher does not push his sexuality on their students, and if they do, then, and only then should they be dismissed. I had plenty of teachers whom were gay when I was in high school. They were the best listeners and definitely fun teaching the classes.

Jeff R. Johnson was one of the first openly gay seminarians in the Lutheran church (ELCA) and a founder of a Lutheran movement to extraordinarily ordain publicly identified LGBT people. Ordained in 1990, Pastor Johnson currently serves University Lutheran Chapel of Berkeley, CA.

An Oklahoma state law enacted in 1978[1] authorized schools to fire teachers for "[engaging] in public homosexual conduct or activity"; and "[has] been rendered unfit, because of such conduct or activity, to hold a position as a teacher, student teacher or teachers' aide. "[2] The National Gay Task Force filed a facial, class-action challenge to this law on First and Fourteenth Amendment grounds.[3]

 Teachers are american citizens too! They have every right to be gay as much as everybody else and there is no problem with it! It doesnt affect schooling for children so what does it matter! There's also the first amendment which is freedom of expression! Its in the constitution! Americans are in a free country!

It amazes me that "religious" institutions are still allowed to get away with this crap.  Cohabitation with someone of either sex is not illegal.  Terminating a pregnancy is not illegal.  Marrying someone of the same sex is not illegal.  None of the "morality" issues they cite have any impact on a teachers qualifications.  This is a giant plate of WTF.

Should students be allowed to bring electronic devices to school?
When asked should students be allowed to bring electronic devices to school, the short answer is yes, in general, though the school should be able to restrict when they can be used if they can show a real reason. Having three teenagers in school, each of whom has their own cell phone and tablet, I have great familiarity with the issues surrounding this question. In each of their schools, the administrations have decided to allow the students more and more freedom with the devices, and at one school actively encourage all students to bring them every day, to make internet research easier. However, the rules need to be set by each school, to meet the needs and situations at each school, and sometimes may be different in different classrooms.

Pretty much everywhere, cell phones are banned because most people say it's distracting. Teachers don't want kids texting in class when they're trying to teach them important things. But the truth about more modern phones is they can be a great learning tool. Students can use calculators (most likely not during math), stopwatches, timers, educational apps, the internet, and more with their mobile phones nowadays. School filters can connect with the wifi and be used to filter specific things that need to be filtered. Also, cell phones should also be used for safety. The employees at a school say you don't need to use your phone to contact people but what if something happens like the school phone line goes dead? Also, if you need a phone number the school doesn't have, it will most likely be under your contacts list. And if students might need to contact a student in another class for something important, they can always contact them. And if a student is sick, they can Facetime or Skype another student during class to watch the lesson and not miss anything important.

But owning, or having access to, technology is usually only a first step. Even more important is learning how to use it. This is one of the biggest challenges facing anyone who wishes to use electronic tools, because the knowledge is not always easy to acquire. Many people, of course, are highly skilled in computer technology and know how to teach themselves to do almost anything. But many other people have limited computer skills, are easily intimidated by new and unfamiliar tasks, and tend to avoid doing anything that requires them to learn something very different from the things to which they are accustomed. If you fall in the latter group but wish to expand your ability to use electronic tools, you need to find help. Some institutions offer extensive assistance through their computer centers or their information technology services. Some departments have staff members or graduate student assistants who are hired to handle computer-related problems. There are also many excellent reference works to help you learn about various electronic tools. Just as you must be sure that you have the necessary technology at your disposal before you decide to use electronic tools in your teaching, so you must also make sure that you have access to the necessary help in learning to use it.

Although some BYOD programs have been successful and district officials insist that they are the best and only available option, many teachers and public education advocates are left wondering, where will BYOD lead? As schools across the country lose potentially more funding, are students and their families now supposed to make up the difference? How will the prevalence of these devices affect the classroom?
