Should boys and girls be in separate classes?

When asked should boys and girls be in separate classes, the short answer is boys and girls should not be separated!. I feel that I work better in a mixed gender class then I would in a class with only boys. I admit that sometimes girls can be a bother but schools function better with different genders than working with just boys or just with girls in the whole student body.


Education is a very important matter. But, what the best way to teach children? Many people disagree that boys and girls should be educated separately. I agree with this people. I think that mixed education is better, then seperately, because boys and girls can help each other. Boys be better in mathematics and science, and girls - in reading and art. Perhaps, this school give boys and girls a chance to socialise wich each other. In my opinion they can make it hard of people to adapt to the normal world after pupils finish school. As for me I think that school without girls would be gloomy and insensitive. With girls our school is interesting, exciting, shining and cheerful! 
 
Heroic Behavior vs. Wedding Cakes Separating boys and girls is a longstanding tradition at private and parochial schools. The concept began to gain traction in American public schools earlier this decade as schools began to experiment with SSPE in oft-desperate attempts to reduce disciplinary problems and improve test scores. The Department of Education accelerated the trend in 2006 by altering the Title IX provision of the No Child Left Behind Act to ease restrictions on gender-segregated education in public schools. 

I totally agree with Samantha above, education should be about the individual child, not reinforcing the stereotypes. I have two boys who couldn’t be more different in learning styles, one very active, the other rather preferring to sit still and read – and I think both gain a lot from being in a class with girls and also with other kids who have different styles. After all, they will have to work and get along socially in diverse mixed environments. Plus, I have to say that I went to an all-girl school and absolutely hated it! 
 
I think what it comes down to is that it’s best to be aware of where we have historically short-changed girls and where we might be short-changing boys more recently, and try to offer a variety of approaches throughout a school day/week to try to reach all kinds of learners. To piggyback on some of what Samantha notes about kinesthetic learners, such learners are more common among both genders at younger ages, so focusing on offering only boys that kind of approach does a different kind of disservice. It’s important to try to reach as many kids as possible, but they should all be exposed to many styles of learning, because the best way to become a successful learner is to adapt to a variety of styles, which actually about 80% of learners can do without undue struggle, at least by the time they reach college age.

Should kids use iPads for textbooks in school?

When asked should kids use iPads for textbooks in school, the short answer is iPads would help with their writing. Using an iPad could help kids learn about the keyboard and make kids write more. Students would not have to keep getting up to sharpen their pencils which distracts the teacher and students. When you make a mistake the iPad can help you with it. When people have messy handwriting, their work looks neat and is easy to read on the iPad.


You make some valid points. But the IPADS actually are pre loaded with programs that do not require children to have WIFI or the programs can be updated or uploaded using the schools WIFI then students can use anywhere. I do believe a set of classroom books are important to have but most textbooks now come with online capability and availability.I Like seeing kids carrying a book bag with an IPAD and their lunches instead of all those heavy textbooks!!


Breakage and loss is a problem at Mounts Bay Academy. In a class of 25, there are always a handful of the children who don’t have their iPads with them, either because they are being repaired, have been forgotten or they are waiting for a replacement. Mount Bay has a technical team on site who maintain the iPads and sort out any problems. There are weekly clinics that students can go to when they have technical problems with their iPad. They are insured against loss or damage, but the students have to pay £50 excess for any repairs or a replacement. 


I'm not 100% sold on this idea.Call me old fashioned, but I think our children should be learning to read from regular, ordinary books FIRST and THEN, in time, progress to using other high-tech methods of reading.If we teach our next generation to be so totally dependent on technology, what will happen in 'real world' situations when they can't 'Kindle' or 'Net Surf' their way to solutions or training? Besides, don't those iPads require Wi-FI to function properly?I KNOW all of Raleigh County is NOT Wi-Fi accessable.Few counties in this state are 100% Wi-Fi accessable.Books are better, they can't 'short out' or ever 'run out of battery power.'


My son is a junior at Burlington High School. He and his peers have found the iPad to be a great tool. I have been a proponent of using current technology in schools all my adult life (full disclosure, I was a computer sales professional until I started my own company), and I think that we should give our kids the tools that are available to help them be more competitive in the global marketplace.

Is homeschooling more effective than public school?

If asked is homeschooling more effective than public school, I would say no, homeschooling is not necessarily more effective than public school. What type of schooling is best for a student depends on the individual child, and the teacher. A parent at home with good curriculum could potentially do a much better job than a teacher that under-performs. That being said, a student could do better in a public school setting with great teachers. It's impossible to say which one is better than the other, since so many factors are involved.

So why is it so important to have this question settled once and for all in your mind and heart?  Because, if you do NOT settle it, and get God's perspective on it, you WILL follow the world's way of supposedly educating your children.  Here is what John Taylor Gatto, New York State's "Teacher of the Year" in 1992 said about this: 

Critics of home schooling have expressed concern about a child's well-being when they are kept at home out of the sight of society. Child abuse and neglect is often detected first by officials at the school where an abused child attends, according to the Education Commission of the States. Without exposure to the community, some say that these problems may go undetected, putting the child in danger. Most parents of home-schooled children suggest that the flip side of this argument is that increased parental supervision only enhances the safety of the child; others say that this cannot be accepted across the board as a given. Other pro-home school arguments claim that keeping children away from some public schools that have proven to be dangerous can only improve a child's well-being. 
 
Lauren, I was one of those top 15% kids. trust me, there was nothing gained by the rest of my classmates by having me in their classes, except for someone to pick on and make feel awkward. Which I was, because all I really wanted to be doing was reading a book (which I did under my desk) while my teacher tried to create order in the classroom. My parents, both working full time, had not the time nor the inclination to help out in our public school, which was horribly inconvenient for a working parent to do anyway. We were all much better off when my parents decided to move my sister and I to a private school. I'm not saying private school is always the solution, but being one of the smartest kids in a public school classroom wasn't much of a treat for me. Both the education and the social environment were much better at the private school. 

According to education Web site FamilyEducation.com, the U.S. Department of Education found that home-schooled students had exceptional test scores in comparison to public- and private-school students. Home-schooled students' scores at every grade level in all subjects were considerably higher than those of their traditional-school counterparts. On achievement tests, homeschoolers tested at a higher grade level than those of the same age enrolled in public school programs. Those students who remained in home school throughout their entire childhood scored higher on scholastic achievement test scores than those who attended other programs. The findings concluded that average home school student's scores placed them in the 70th and 80th percentile of all school students nationwide and between the 60th and 70th percentile in comparison to private school students in all skill areas.

Do schools put too much pressure on students nowadays?

When we think do schools put too much pressure on students nowadays, some of us will say too Much Pressure. I just wanted to vote yes! The school puts way too much pressure on students to memorize information and then spit it out on a test. They are not expected to retain it beyond that...Unless it's for final exams. But after that, all the information is gone! It's just a lot of memorization.

The entire process of SEO holds an importance as it is what decides your presence on the internet. In order to be able to reach more people you must be able to show up in the search results and for that SEO is most important. One of the important thing to look after is web hosting and the company you would choose. So why don’t you check the review of these 2 great companies: GoDaddy or Fatcow

Students should always be well-rounded, especially considering we are still about 17 and probably have not even decided what we want to do in life. Personally, I feel that during a student's HSC years, they should never neglect extra-curricular activities and should not treat the HSC as the ultimate test as there are many other pathways to almost all courses. Perhaps the problem with the HSC partly comes from students not being forced to pick certain subjects from all fields and so, many students pick only science and mathematics, including myself, or only humanities and arts.

For those students who have a clear plan for the future, the HSC is just a step along the road. For a very large proportion of students it is absolutely improper to apply so much pressure. The HSC is not a matter of life or death. For those kids who have been led to believe that it is, it can be soul-destroying.

The feelings I had from the film were a bit different.  I have read in other reviews that Abeles should have left us feeling uplifted and that the film was too linear and morose.  While she presents current move to change, and perhaps she doesn’t follow the typical script for inspirational change, I believe that we should be left with a feeling of discomfort

Should girls be able to wear leggings to school?

When we think should girls be able to wear leggings to school, some of us will say what we wear shows who we really are. What we wear and how we wear it expresses/shows who we are as a person. If I want to wear legging then let me wear them, its a clothing choice. Don't force us to wear something if we don't want to wear it or of we don't feel comfortable in it.

Okay, let’s jump right into the first, very important rule about leggings.  Despite the fact that leggings have a waistband and two pant legs, leggings are not pants in the traditional sense and should not be worn as such.  I don’t care if you take six Zumba classes a week and can bounce a quarter off your bottom, please don’t show us your tushes when you wear them.  I shake my head as I give this obvious advice, yet, until I go at least one week without seeing someone (toned or untoned) walking around in a short top and leggings I will continue to preach.  Nobody wants to see your bid’ness, and this includes any views from the front, too.  No matter how thick they are, your leggings should be used like opaque tights without feet and anything you wear with them should cover your butt.

Even leggings are not the actual problem, it is the educational aspect associated with school dressing style. Places that are specially meant for future to take shape as such area of productivity, schools put more focus on teaching students about social norms and why simple thing like legging can turn into a social issue. Institutions must develop or put a scenario before making students follow the dubious dress code solutions. You need to teach them that a bird is not a cow, before showing them how to catch it, rather than forcing them to buy a gun. The first attempt must be always to demonstrate the difference.

i absolutly love leggings. i have a drawer full and they are all i wear. i find jeans unflattering for me for i have hips and do not lik to put them on center stage. but with leggings there is no uncomfy muffintop or low riding show. even in 30 below snow storms leggings are mi go to.. i would love too see more casual outfits that involve boyfriend clothes too!. your article is delicious! i love

I am a little bit baffled, why on earth should a woman have to hide her figure underneath a long, baggy top just because she is larger? I’ll rock my leggings and show off my bum and thighs while I’m at it, thank you ;) Being bigger is nothing to be ashamed about, stop judging other women negatively because they’re comfortable with their own bodies! Just because you want to hide yours doesn’t mean all of us do! ;)

Should school teachers have to wear uniforms?

When we think should school teachers have to wear uniforms, some of us will say teachers who compel students to wear uniform must listen to their   ideas. If they don't it   means that they think themselves superior to the children. The teachers would have to be known and would have to be seen in any seen as this would help the children understand and believe what to do. Also in school excursions the teacher may be seen in their plain clothes as compare to the children's uniform. This us one reason.

Sacha from Wisconsin, U.S.I think dress codes are very important, but I also think that people should be able to express their selves through clothing to an extent, the uniforms you have on this website are very cute and I wouldn't mind wearing them. I really want to go to your country before I turn 16, I'm 14 right now but I'm turning 15 in August. 

Shalini Singh from CanadaMy school has uniforms and they are so lame I mean we have red, khaki, hunter green, and white. I don't like uniforms.Lianna Llanes, U.S. Hello, I'm a freshman and I am considered a goth. I have black hair and a pierced nose. I wear eyeliner dark, and I wear all black clothing. Our school is trying to prevent all of that. I have had absolutely no disciplinary problems at school. I'm a pretty good student. So what's the big deal?

i believet that students should choose rather they want to wear uniforms. some people express themselves through their clothing and for those children that doesn’t like being like everyone else this might be a little hard for those people!! i know that children must follow the rules but i believe that children need to express themselves as far as what they want to wear in school!!! please reply back to this rather you agree or not!!!
