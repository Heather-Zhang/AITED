Is homeschooling more effective than public school?

If asked is homeschooling more effective than public school, I would say no, homeschooling is not necessarily more effective than public school. What type of schooling is best for a student depends on the individual child, and the teacher. A parent at home with good curriculum could potentially do a much better job than a teacher that under-performs. That being said, a student could do better in a public school setting with great teachers. It's impossible to say which one is better than the other, since so many factors are involved.

So why is it so important to have this question settled once and for all in your mind and heart?  Because, if you do NOT settle it, and get God's perspective on it, you WILL follow the world's way of supposedly educating your children.  Here is what John Taylor Gatto, New York State's "Teacher of the Year" in 1992 said about this: 

Critics of home schooling have expressed concern about a child's well-being when they are kept at home out of the sight of society. Child abuse and neglect is often detected first by officials at the school where an abused child attends, according to the Education Commission of the States. Without exposure to the community, some say that these problems may go undetected, putting the child in danger. Most parents of home-schooled children suggest that the flip side of this argument is that increased parental supervision only enhances the safety of the child; others say that this cannot be accepted across the board as a given. Other pro-home school arguments claim that keeping children away from some public schools that have proven to be dangerous can only improve a child's well-being. 
 
Lauren, I was one of those top 15% kids. trust me, there was nothing gained by the rest of my classmates by having me in their classes, except for someone to pick on and make feel awkward. Which I was, because all I really wanted to be doing was reading a book (which I did under my desk) while my teacher tried to create order in the classroom. My parents, both working full time, had not the time nor the inclination to help out in our public school, which was horribly inconvenient for a working parent to do anyway. We were all much better off when my parents decided to move my sister and I to a private school. I'm not saying private school is always the solution, but being one of the smartest kids in a public school classroom wasn't much of a treat for me. Both the education and the social environment were much better at the private school. 

According to education Web site FamilyEducation.com, the U.S. Department of Education found that home-schooled students had exceptional test scores in comparison to public- and private-school students. Home-schooled students' scores at every grade level in all subjects were considerably higher than those of their traditional-school counterparts. On achievement tests, homeschoolers tested at a higher grade level than those of the same age enrolled in public school programs. Those students who remained in home school throughout their entire childhood scored higher on scholastic achievement test scores than those who attended other programs. The findings concluded that average home school student's scores placed them in the 70th and 80th percentile of all school students nationwide and between the 60th and 70th percentile in comparison to private school students in all skill areas.
