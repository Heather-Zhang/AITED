Title:  Should school lunches always be healthy?
Thesis:  I would say that school lunches should not always be healthy. As a student I know that as time goes on any and all options that students do enjoy are replaced by these new healthy alternatives that no one likes.

Most importantly, the family needs to be involved in helping children to understand the principles of sound nutrition and to make healthy food choices. So much of what children learn about eating, they learn at home. In recognition of this basic fact, Team Nutrition is developing and distributing materials designed to educate children, their parents and the community at large about the importance of sound nutrition and the necessity for children to eat balanced meals. To learn more about these materials, click here. Ultimately, we expect that these efforts will lead children to choose healthier diets, not only in school but also throughout their lives.

When joint custody has been awarded and the child physically changes residence, the child is considered part of the household where she/he resides. In these situations, if both parents apply for benefits in the same LEA for the child, and different eligibility statuses result, the greatest benefit level is used. For example, if the mother’s situation results in eligibility for free meals but the father’s application is denied, the child would receive free meals regardless of which parent had custody at the time.

Save a quarter of your plate for whole grains—not just any grains: MyPlate tells you to reserve a quarter of your plate for grains. But grains are not essential for good health. What’s essential is to make any grains you eat whole grains, since these have a gentler effect on blood sugar and insulin than refined grains. Whole grains include whole wheat, brown rice, oats, barley, and the like, as well as foods made with them, such as whole wheat pasta. The less processed the whole grains, the better: Finely ground grain is more rapidly digested, and in turn, has a greater impact on blood sugar than more coarsely ground or intact grains. So choose steel cut oats instead of instant, sugared oats or choose whole wheatberries instead of whole wheat bread.
