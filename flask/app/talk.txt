Is homeschooling better than public schooling?

If asked is homeschooling better than public schooling, I would say homeschooling is much better than public schools. Its less stressful and you like to learn about things. I hate public schools that are less fun and the teachers can be mean. Some teachers don't teach the way that you can learn. You don't have to get up early and you have better food .You can still see freinds

That is why, unlike those who wish to suppress homeschooling, homeschool parents are rarely if ever heard demanding that the government pass a law demanding that every other family in the country do things the way they do. Unlike our German friends, homeschool parents do not wish to seize custody of other people’s children simply because they prefer a different model of education. The irony here is that more than a few of our public schools are so dangerous and dysfunctional that sending one’s children there really ought to be considered an act of neglect, if not for the fact that those poor parents have practically no choice in the matter.

According to some researches, there are more than 2.04 million students who are doing the homeschool in United States of America. The number keeps on increasing over 75% since 1999. In Indonesia itself, the number of families that choose to use the homeschooling is still increasing. According to HSLDA (Home School Legal Defense Association), there are over 2000 families that choose homeschool for their children. By this fact, there are still more Indonesian families that choose public schools as their best way to educate the children.

Many people ask about which one has the better result, the homeschool or public school? Some researches that are done in United States says that the homeschooled students have a better result in the GPA and also has more percentage in graduation rate. Parents often times worry about their children’s ability in making relationship with peers if they take the  homeschooling. This can be solved by joining them in some courses or community programs. These are some comparison between homeschooling and public schools. These may help the parents to decide the best way to educate the children and provide the suitable way of education to the children.

Looking at me you might never know I am abnormal. A casual, and possibly even an in-depth conversation might not clue you in either, but the truth is I am a member of a highly controversial club. You see, I was homeschooled. And not just a my-parents-tried-it-for-a-year-because-I-didn’t-have-friends sort of a homeschooler. I mean, I never set foot in a public school.

"A high-speed connection is no more an essential civil right than 3G cell phone service or a Netflix account. Increasing competition and restoring academic excellence in abysmal public schools is far more of an imperative to minority children than handing them iPads."--Michelle Malkin
