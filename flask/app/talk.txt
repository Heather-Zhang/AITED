Humanities' Decline That Makes Economic Sense

If the share of degrees in the humanities is falling,  it is because in a modern economy what you take in college determines what you make. A humanities degree, all by itself, is unlikely to make you rich.  Colleges benefit from humanities, but if they don’t make students employable, they are unlikely to achieve their broader goals for human flourishing. 


Judging by the recent report, “Mapping the Future,” issued by Harvard University and by worried editorials for the past several years in academic humanities journals and the mainstream press, one would conclude that the study of literature, philosophy, art, and history is in trouble, if not in crisis. The report on the humanities by the American Academy of Arts & Science requested by Congress and released June 19 responds to a decline educators have been noting for years in enrollments and employment in the humanities.

On June 18, 2013, a 61-page report called “The Heart of the Matter” was delivered on Capitol Hill. Led by the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and produced by the Commission on the Humanities and Social Sciences, the report addresses concerns regarding the “dramatic” decline in the percentage of humanities degrees conferred since its peak in 1966.

Through the humanities we reflect on the fundamental question: What does it mean to be human? The humanities offer clues but never a complete answer. They reveal how people have tried to make moral, spiritual, and intellectual sense of a world in which irrationality, despair, loneliness, and death are as conspicuous as birth, friendship, hope, and reason.

Recently, Blu Homes has been approached by several clients who were interested in tearing down decrepit homes and rebuilding a Blu home in that house's place. Although the existing homes were suffering from too many structural issues to renovate efficiently, we knew there had to be a green way to approach the issue of a teardown. As part of the process of rebuilding the homes, we've been researching how to recycle an existing home. If you're one of those homeowners who has been wondering about the best way to environmentally approach a teardown and rebuild, we have good news: recycling a home makes environmental sense as well as economic sense.

"People of my age who went to college, go into college, you know what it cost back then? Nothing or next to nothing. At the most, you had to work at Dairy Queen during the summer and that would pay for your college education."--Michael Moore
