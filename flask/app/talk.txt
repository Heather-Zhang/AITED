States Matter: America Is a Federal Republic

James Madison, a strong federal government advocate in 1787, couldn't have been any clearer in articulating the significant powers delegated to the states under the new Constitution. In Federalist 45, he wrote:  The powers delegated by the proposed Constitution to the federal government are few and defined. Those which are to remain in the State governments are numerous and indefinite. The former will be exercised principally on external objects, as war, peace, negotiation, and foreign commerce.... The powers reserved to the several States will extend to all the objects which, in the ordinary course of affairs, concern the lives, liberties, and properties of the people, and the internal order, improvement, and prosperity of the State. 


Denied powers: Powers that the Constitution         explicitly denies to the federal government. These include:  The writ of habeas corpus cannot be suspended unless in             cases of rebellion or invasion, when deemed necessary to             national safety. No bill of attainder or ex post facto law can be           passed.  

The United States is exactly that--a Union of states. Each state has its own individual powers. However, that does not mean that the states have power to legislate on all matters. The Constitution of the United States spells out the powers of the federal government and of the "several states." The Union government (known as the federal government) has its own fields of legislation, and if federal legislation conflicts with the state laws, the federal legislation prevails. If this occurs, the state must defer to the federal government. The alternative, that any state may at any time leave the Union and thus be free from Union interference in the state's internal affairs, was tried during the American Civil War.

Even as public views of the federal government in Washington have fallen to another new low, the public continues to see their state and local governments in a favorable light. Overall, 63% say they have a favorable opinion of their local government, virtually unchanged over recent years. And 57% express a favorable view of their state government â€“ a five-point uptick from last year. By contrast, just 28% rate the federal government in Washington favorably. That is down five points from a year ago and the lowest percentage ever in a Pew Research Center survey.

Federal law develops at the national level. It applies to the nation as a whole and to all 50 states, the District of Columbia and all U.S. territories. The supreme body of law at the federal level is the U.S. Constitution, which establishes the powers and responsibilities of government and preserves the basic rights of every citizen. The highest legal authority at the federal level is the U.S. Supreme Court.

"I think that the press has a duty and an obligation to report on local government, state government, federal government - to be aggressive, to do its job. And its job is to report on whatever it's covering."--Mark McKinnon
