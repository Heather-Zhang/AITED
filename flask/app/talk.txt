Should textbooks be replaced with tablets (iPads, etc.)?

If asked should textbooks be replaced with tablets (iPads, etc.), I would say yes, I Am Sure. Because kids get fruterated of rading are writing. Tablets are fun and thats what i think you should think that to you know i once didnt return a paper then i got busted but now that never happened one i stared using tablets!!!!! Tablets are great i am writing essay on should text books be replaced with tablets? Thanks!

I am on the fence over this one. Neha is right about the research and that findings will be significantly different down the road. My eldest niece, who started college this year (in her mid 30s) is my voice on this one. She had a number of digital textbooks, but prefers some subjectsmath and chemistry in particularas real books. She tried digital but says something about the traditional books makes it easier for her with courses that are heavily math based. It will probably be like this for many students, that some courses are better with traditional books and others better with the digital format.  For me, when I am home, I like a real book. But I travel for work frequently and for that, my Kindle and my iPad, cannot be replaced. And that got me thinking.

Think of this -In my personal opinion, I think schools should stop using textbooks. They constantly change and schools don't always have all the money in the world to keep updating them, and don't get me started on all the paper we're wasting. It would be a lot easier to get students an inexpensive piece of technology. Kids wouldn't have to carry around tons of heavy books and they would have access to all the latest information. We should take advantage of the technology we have today and use it for the better. I think it would be a very good investment.

The fact is that Advocates of the idea have said allowing children to use tablets or laptops would give them more flexibility in terms of research opportunities. With computers, students can expand on what they've learned rather than working from prepared texts. Aside from that, the devices may help districts cut down on the need to replace aging textbooks. And that is the truth.

So I make the argument that Update: An early comment reminded me that I should have pointed out that school districts can write their own textbooks and save hundreds of thousands of dollars. It's also possible for a single teacher to customize a textbook for their class or even for a school district to forgo textbooks entirely (here). And then there are the digital textbook repositories that a number of states have started (California, for one). It's tough but it can be done! I would like to end with a quote by Douglas Rushkoff -

"The iPad - contrary to the way most people thought about it - is not a tablet computer running the Apple operating system. It's more like a very big iPhone, running the iPhone operating system."
