Should textbooks be replaced with tablets (iPads, etc.)?

When we think should textbooks be replaced with tablets (iPads, etc.), some of us will say yes because kids always having back problems and ipads and etc. Can fix that prblem. Don't parents get tired of buying bookbag all year loong.. Cause of the texrbooks , binders and etc... I think ipads is the best thing for the children to carry around cause they learn enough .. I think what they do learn is about enough when your child grows up do you want her to   have back problems .. Cause i know i dontsoo thats why i think they should have ipads its the best thing for them

No, this actually isn’t another “textbooks are the future so let’s discard the past” type of story. Quinn looks to have a good grasp on the value of OER (open educational resources). “So a teacher in the Bronx can pull together the most relevant information for his class, and update it throughout the year to stay current,” Quinn explained. “He can incorporate videos and interactive multimedia assignments that better engage kids living in a digital world. By using tablets instead of textbooks, the possibilities really are limitless.”

 					This autumn, the schoolbags of pupils attending the Savonlinna Teacher Training School of the University of Eastern Finland are much lighter than before, thanks to tablet computers. Approximately half of the school's pupils and teachers now use personal tablet computers instead of traditional textbooks. The project includes a group of first graders who began their school path this autumn, as well as all of the school's seventh grade students. The seventh graders continuing to general upper secondary level will be among the first Finnish students to complete their matriculation examinations electronically. 				  

I’ve read dozens of opinions and research reports on the topic of textbooks and tablets in schools.  As you might expect, there are different perspectives on the subject.  A popular way for articles to frame the conversation is to compare tablets with textbooks, as if having one excluded use of the other.  Of course, this is not the case.  Nonetheless, the following visual (click on it for a larger version) represents some of the different perspectives as well as references to summaries of a couple of research reports related to the topic.  I’d appreciate your additions and contributions in the comment section.

Based on these parameters, the future savings would result in saving $60 per student, which considering there are more than 49 million students in public schools equates to nearly $3 billion in savings — nearly half the price of traditional textbooks today. Still, how can a price reduction of $100 in tablets only result in a $60 savings? Other factors besides the fixed price of the tablets account for the difference.

"The iPad - contrary to the way most people thought about it - is not a tablet computer running the Apple operating system. It's more like a very big iPhone, running the iPhone operating system."--Douglas Rushkoff
