Is BioShock Infinite the best game of this generation?

When we think is BioShock Infinite the best game of this generation, some of us will say substance, quality and heart. I'm sure Bioshock Infinite won't be the game I've played the most this generation. However, its story, characters, setting, and game play will definitely stand out as what I think is an experience that was of the most quality of any game I've played this current console generation. This game is fun, intelligent and was obviously made with extreme care, yearly installment games could learn from Bioshock infinite, that taking time with your game increases the experience.

When the first developers began trying to tell complex stories in their games they realised that they needed to create entirely new genres to do so. Text adventures and role-players achieved this aim very well but their compromise was the absence of any arcade style action. It soon became commonplace for action games to include stories too, but generally only via non-interactive cut scenes. BioShock Infinite though is not satisfied with any such compromise.

The tragedy of BioShock Infinite is that it’s a game of big ideas saddled to what amounts to a rehash of the experience of that first time you entered Rapture some six years ago. The architecture is different, the underlying philosophies espoused in audio journals tweaked, but the sum of the parts is the same, if delivered less well. Where BioShock was a frightening, oppressive experience that coupled the fear of what lurked around the next corner with an unquenchable desire to explore around that corner, BioShock Infinite’s Columbia lacks that magical draw. Infinite is not a bad game — it’s an extremely competent FPS that must be commended for sometimes taking on hard topics, creating an often beautifully realized world, and pushing the envelope of polish and story in video games in some important, key ways. I think you should play it.

BioShock: Infinite came out last week, and everybody is talking about it for one simple reason: It's easily the best game in recent memory. That doesn't mean it's perfect, however. There are a host of issues that might scare you away from Infinite before and even while you're playing it. I want to address those issues as somebody who shared those same concerns. And I will spend the first page of this column doing so. There will be no spoilers on the first page, not counting the comments -- but then, if you're worried about spoilers, you should already be ducking the comment section like you owe it money.
