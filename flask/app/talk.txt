Do "creationists" forget that there are differing creation stories in differing religions and cultures?

When asked do "creationists" forget that there are differing creation stories in differing religions and cultures, the short answer is no, they don't forget. In every religion there are different stories explaining the creation of the Universe. Whether it be the Olympian gods or the Christian God, EVERY religion accepts the idea of creationism. The difference being is HOW humanity was created. They all have the same basic belief that an omniscient being(s) created the universe, just HOW and WHEN they created the universe and humanity differs amongst religions. But overall yes, they do know that their are different creation theories amongst different religions, but they all share the same basic belief of creationism.wer and sexuality of a woman that is controlled and degraded to a maid.

I can't stand high heels.  What if we miss the train because she trips and falls?  What if we are being chased by a bear and she falls and gets eaten?  What if she rolls her ankle and can't play tennis with me anymore?  What if she gets mad at me and wants to kick me? What if it's dark in the house and she doesn't know I'm sleeping on the floor?Yeah...I'm just making it up at this point.  Seriously, I've never understood the point of high heels.  The most common response I get is that it makes her calfs look better.  Well, that's what shoulder shrugs are for!  Get some hand weights and do shoulder shrugs, and then you can get the benefits of high heels without needing high heels!  Kind of like putting a little sea salt in your water instead of buying Gatorade.

What you need to do is find a good shoe store, not a cheap one. For a good pair that are made well and will be comfortable you will be spending anywhere from $50 and up. Then when you go home slip on a sexy outfit and watch yourself in  a full mirror and walk. It is not only something you need to learn how to walk in, but you need to let your confidense shine through, that’s where your sex appeal helps you out. If you could practice with a high heel boots it would be better. They help keep your foot more secure. From my 25 yrs. experience of wearing heels these are the easiest to get used to and walk with confidense. You must be comfortable with the shoes in order to look good in them. Good luck

Yesterday evening at a demo day in Midtown, Jorge Cortell, the CEO of a healthcare startup and a self-described "hacker-hacktivist" took a creepshot of a female attendee's high heels and posted it his public Twitter account with the following caption: "Event supposed to be for entrepreneurs, VCs, but these heels (I've seen several like this)... WTF? #brainsnotrequired"
