Are beauty pageants good for girls?

When we think are beauty pageants good for girls, some of us will say no they aren't. Beauty conteats promote an unrealistic standard of beauty. Many participants are very thin, have perfect teeth, and jave professionally done makeup and hair. Few women can ever look like the conteatanta in beauty contests no matter how hard they try. For example, sociologists argue that beauty contests put preasure on women to meet unrealistic standards of beauty. Further more, they promote the idea that beautiful women are better than other people.

 	There are pros and cons to your teen participating in any extra curricular activity, and beauty pageants are no exception. Pageants are a great way toinstill both positive self esteem, and confidence into girls. In Western culture, girls are constantly bombarded with media images of idealized beauty, which can have negative affects on their fragile psyches. Any activity that reinforces both inner and outer beauty (most pageants do in spite of all the glitzy make-up), is a good thing. And that got me thinking.

There are two problems with that argument. Being judged on the basis of your beauty is no more "objectification" than taking a college exam and being judged on your intellect; yet, as far as I know, every student will take exams. Moreover, absolutely no data supports a connection between beauty pageants and violence against women.

The fact is that Have you ever been involved with child pageants? You know - beauty pageants for kids. Maybe you're one of those people who thinks beauty pageants are bad for the contestants. Or maybe you think they're okay for older girls, but that they're not okay for young children. There has been a debate raging for years about beauty pageants, especially about entering young children in glitz pageants. Many people think they're evil, claiming that the beauty pageants are more for the parents than for the children. Aficianados swear that their kids love doing the pageants. So who's telling the truth? And more important, are child pageants good or bad? And that is the truth.

Beauty pageants have dominated the news this past week. First the French Senate banned them with for girls under 16, threatening a two-year prison sentence and stiff fines of thirty thousand Euros for organizers -- or parents -- who enter their children into illegally organized contests. The French bill referenced the spate of advertising already occurring in France with hypersexual images of prepubescent girls showing up in advertising and the potential negative mental health effects to girls of sexualizing them at a young age by requiring them to wear heavy makeup and provocative attire. I would like to end with a quote by Gwen Stefani -

"If I wasn't even famous or had any success, I would still wake up and put tons of make-up on, and put on a cool outfit. That's always been who I've been my whole life, so that's never gonna change. I love fashion. I love getting dressed up. I love Halloween, too."
