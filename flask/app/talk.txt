Atheism Should End Religion, Not Replace It

Religion cannot and should not be replaced by atheism.  Religion needs to go away and not be replaced by anything.  Atheism is not a religion. It’s the absence of religion, and that’s a wonderful thing.   Atheism is the absence of religion. We don’t really need atheism. We just need to get rid of religion. 


Picture the scene. A harlot is sitting on the back of a fearsome beast. The beast has seven heads and ten horns. (Revelation 17:1-4) Whom does the harlot represent? She exerts influence “over the kings of the earth.” She dresses in purple, uses incense, and is exceedingly wealthy. In addition, by means of her spiritistic practice, ‘all the nations are misled.’ (Revelation 17:18; 18:12, 13, 23) The Bible helps us to see that this harlot is a worldwide religious entity. She depicts, not any one religion, but all religions that produce rotten fruit.

Penn Jillette: We've done three magic books together and I wrote two novels without you. I wanted to put something out there that was all me, my ideas and beliefs and take on things that would be thought-provoking and funny. I do a lot of op-ed stuff and TV pundit stuff. I'm always the nut on those panels that they go to for a joke, but end up being the guy the host says "Hey, Penn’s a whack job, but he’s right." Oh, and I guess I talk about you, too.

Penn: It's a pretty funny look my life and all the goofy things that are important to me: skepticism, truth, atheism, our show, my family and friends, libertarianism. I share funny stories about those things and talk about my beliefs and even tell one about the skin falling of my scrotum. Oh, and I guess I talk about you, too.

“Intelligent people typically spend more time in school—a form of self-regulation that may yield long-term benefits,” according to the study. “More intelligent people get higher-level jobs (and better employment (and higher salary) may lead to higher self-esteem and encourage personal control beliefs.”
