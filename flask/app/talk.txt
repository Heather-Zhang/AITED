Was the United States decision to bomb enemy cities during World War 2 morally justifiable?

If asked was the United States decision to bomb enemy cities during World War 2 morally justifiable, I would say the decision to bomb enemy cities during WWII was not morally justifiable. I believe that bombing the enemy cities was not morally justifiable. Killing innocent people is never the answer for any situation. Although we needed to   boost our morale, the innocent people did nothing to us, so therefore why should we kill them? I believe the U.S. could have handled the situation differently, instead only killing the threat and not the innocent.n homeschoolers doesn't necessarily take away from public schools. Those of us who homeschool would never enroll our children in a public school, so it actually takes away from parochial schools in many cases.Also, you think every homeschooled child wants to be educated? Ha! That's hilarious. You say you're just debunking a study, but truly your biased against homeschooling shows, as your logic pertaining to the study is flawed. 

According to some researches, there are more than 2.04 million students who are doing the homeschool in United States of America. The number keeps on increasing over 75% since 1999. In Indonesia itself, the number of families that choose to use the homeschooling is still increasing. According to HSLDA (Home School Legal Defense Association), there are over 2000 families that choose homeschool for their children. By this fact, there are still more Indonesian families that choose public schools as their best way to educate the children.

  		To government, homeschooling resembles a weed that spreads and resists control. To homeschooling parents, it is the flowering of knowledge and values within children who have been abandoned or betrayed by public schools. A great tension exists between the two perspectives. Homeschooling’s continued growth has only heightened it.
